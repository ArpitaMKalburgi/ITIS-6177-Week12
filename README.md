**API for Product Management**
**Introduction**

This project is an API for managing product data, built using the Xmysql auto-generator. The API provides various endpoints to interact with a product database, allowing actions such as retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting product records. This API is designed to facilitate product management tasks, with capabilities like counting, grouping, and aggregating data, making it ideal for inventory management systems or e-commerce applications.

**Tools and Technologies Used**
    Xmysql: An API auto-generator tool that creates REST APIs directly from a MySQL database schema.
    MySQL: A relational database management system used to store and manage product data.
    Postman: A tool for testing and interacting with API endpoints.

**Installation and Setup**

Follow these steps to set up and run the API on your local machine.
1. Install MySQL
    1.Download and install MySQL from the official MySQL website.
    2.Set up a database named testdb (or your preferred database name) and create a table for products. Here’s a basic schema:

   		CREATE DATABASE testdb;
		USE testdb;
	
		CREATE TABLE products (
		    product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
		    name VARCHAR(50),
		    description TEXT,
		    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
		    stock INT
		);
    3.Insert some sample data to test the API:
   
	   	INSERT INTO products (name, description, price, stock) VALUES
		('Product 1', 'Description for product 1', 19.99, 100),
		('Product 2', 'Description for product 2', 29.99, 50);

3. Install Node.js and Xmysql
    Download and install Node.js.
    Open a terminal or command prompt and install Xmysql globally using npm:
   
   	 	npm install -g xmysql

5. Run Xmysql to Generate the API
   1.Start the Xmysql server and connect it to your MySQL database. Replace root and password with your MySQL credentials:
   
		xmysql -h localhost -u root -p password -d testdb
   Xmysql will generate and host your API at http://localhost:3000. It will also display a list of generated endpoints in the terminal.

7. Testing the API Endpoints
Now that the API is running, you can test the endpoints using Postman or any API client of your choice. Here are some example endpoints to try:
    Get All Products: Retrieve a list of all products.
   
        URL: http://localhost:3000/api/products
        Method: GET

    Create New Product: Add a new product to the database.
   
        URL: http://localhost:3000/api/products
        Method: POST
        Body (JSON):

	    {
	      "name": "New Product",
	      "description": "Description of the new product",
	      "price": 29.99,
	      "stock": 100
	    }

Update Product by ID: Update an existing product’s details.

    URL: http://localhost:3000/api/products/1
    Method: PUT
    Body (JSON):
        {
          "name": "Updated Product",
          "description": "Updated description",
          "price": 39.99,
          "stock": 50
        }
    Delete Product by ID: Delete a product from the database.
        URL: http://localhost:3000/api/products/1
        Method: DELETE

**Reflection**

Working on this project provided me with hands-on experience in setting up and managing REST APIs directly from a MySQL database. By using Xmysql, I was able to quickly generate a functional API without writing manual backend code, which demonstrated the power of auto-generators for rapid development. This process highlighted the importance of database schema design, as any changes in the database structure directly impacted the API endpoints. Additionally, troubleshooting the setup and ensuring smooth connectivity between MySQL and Xmysql improved my understanding of database management and API integration.
Learning Outcomes

**Through this project, I achieved the following learning outcomes:**

a. Understanding of API Auto-Generation: Gained insight into how tools like Xmysql can create APIs from a database schema, speeding up development for CRUD operations.
b. Database and API Integration: Improved my knowledge of integrating MySQL with Node.js and handling database queries via API endpoints.
c. Experience with RESTful Endpoints: Familiarized myself with various RESTful methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and their practical applications in managing product data.
d. Postman Testing Skills: Enhanced my skills in testing API endpoints using Postman, ensuring that each endpoint performs as expected.
e. Problem-Solving and Debugging: Learned how to troubleshoot common issues in database connectivity and API responses, which strengthened my problem-solving abilities.

**This project was a valuable step in understanding the development and testing of APIs, a critical skill in modern web and mobile applications.**
